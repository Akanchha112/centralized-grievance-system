<h1 align="center">E-Grievance Portal</h1>

<h3 align="center">Our Problem statement.</h3>
<p>Every year millions of students take admissions in the
universities throughoutIndia. A lot of students face
problems and certain issues which remain unheard.
Here, in our project we oughtto bring out solutions for
"STUDENT GRIEVANCES."</p><br>

<p>As Our Solution, we are building up a portal that would
help students to come up with their grievances and
that would be resolved there and then.</p>

<h3 align= "center">What are We Building?</h3>
<p>We are building a website wherein a valid studentis
allowed to address his issues be itrelated to
academics, managerial, financial, maintenance, faculty-related issues</p>

<h3 align= "center">Why E-Grievance Portal?<h3>
<p>Students do face many problems on day-to-day basis,
and there is no particular environment set up to help
them. So,their problems remain unheard and
unresolved, and they end up losing faith in the institute.</p>
<br>
<p>So,to overcome this problem we are creating an online
centralized portalto getthose problems tracked and
resolved effectively!</p>

  <h3 align="center">Future Scope..</h3>
<p>The futuristic scope of our project is to add up a 24*7 Chat feature wherein a
  Consultant would deal with the problems of the students by interacting live.</p>
<p>We can extend this grievance portal for queries that a faculty could have towards the management.</p>
<p>We can also create a grievance or helpline portal for Female students and teachers dealing with the problems of their domain
  separately</p>

  efficient solution to our problem statement.</p>
<p align="center">With this effort we hope thatthe grievances ofthe students would

# Getting Started with Create React App and use centralized grievance system

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
